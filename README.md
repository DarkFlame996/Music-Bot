# Music-bot
This is my own replacement since rythm got murdered. Its still VERY sperimental due to me having 0 knowledge on bots and how to make them work. If you have suggestions
or you find bugs make an issue report on my Github page at this link
https://github.com/DarkFlame996/Music-Bot.git
the bot requires, of course, the following dependencies:
  -Discord.js
  -node.js ofc
